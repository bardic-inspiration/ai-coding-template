# AGENTS.md — Canonical Guide for AI Coding Agents

This is the **authoritative guide** for how work is done in this repository, by
agents or humans. If another doc disagrees with this one, this one wins —
except that [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) is the source of truth for *what to build*;
this file is the source of truth for *how to work*.

Work is done by AI sessions that start with no memory of earlier ones.
Nothing carries over except what's in the repo and on GitHub — issues, PRs,
review threads, and the commit history — so every rule below exists to make
one session's work legible to the next.

## Purpose & scope

What the project is, and what it deliberately isn't, lives in one place:
[`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) "Purpose & non-goals". Work bigger than one PR is
sequenced by open plan issues — issues labeled `plan`, with their tasks as
sub-issues ([`docs/spec-driven-development.md`](docs/spec-driven-development.md)
"Plans").

## How work happens

Two modes build; a spike explores. Every change reaches `main` the same way
— a PR, a green check, a human merge — whichever mode produced it. A spike
never reaches `main` at all ([`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md)
"Spikes").

| | Interactive session | Routine | Spike |
|---|---|---|---|
| Who's there | The user, in the loop | Nobody, until review | Usually the user |
| Where the task comes from | Chat, or an issue | An issue: handed to it, or the next in the queue | A question |
| Where the task is recorded | The PR description — file an issue only for work this session won't do | The issue | The findings, in a draft PR |
| When blocked | Ask the user | Say so on the issue or PR, and stop | Record it — a dead end is a finding |
| After opening the PR | Watch CI to green, and report | Watch CI to green | File the follow-ups, then close it unmerged |

The thread through all three: **the task is the prompt, the PR is the
response, review is the evaluation, and the squash commit on `main` is the
record** — for a spike, the closed PR's findings are the record.

## Hard rules

These hold for every change, whatever the task says. A change that breaks one
is wrong even if CI is green.

- **Red CI is never merged**, and tests are never skipped, disabled, or
  weakened to get green ([`docs/ci.md`](docs/ci.md)).
- **Don't silently invent behavior.** If the spec or the task is ambiguous or
  looks wrong, resolve it in the spec rather than guessing in code.
- **The project's invariants hold** — [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) "Invariants".
- **One concern per PR**, and only what its task asks for
  ([`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md) "Scope").
- **A PR you open is yours until it's merged or closed** — watch its CI and
  fix what fails ([`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md) "Watching CI").
- **Spike code never merges.** A spike's output is its findings; the real
  work is rebuilt through the working loop.
- **The repo is the memory.** Decisions, follow-ups, and open questions go
  into the spec, issues, and PR descriptions — never only into a chat the next
  session can't see.

## Repo layout

<!-- TEMPLATE: extend the tree with the project's own top-level directories.
Mark anything that doesn't exist yet as "(planned)". -->

## Working loop

1. **Take one task.** Interactive: from chat, or an issue. Routine: the issue
   you were handed, or the next in the queue
   ([`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md) "The queue").
2. **Read before you write:** the task, the `SPEC.md` sections it cites, and
   every doc it references. `git log` on the files you'll touch is context
   too — each commit on `main` is one whole PR, with its why in the body.
3. **Branch from `main`** ([`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md) "Branches").
4. **Test first.** A failing test, the minimal code to pass it, then refactor
   ([`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md)).
5. **Run `check`** (Commands, below). Green before every push.
6. **Open one PR.** Its title and description become the commit on `main`
   ([`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md) "Pull requests"). If it changes
   behavior, it updates `SPEC.md` too.
7. **Watch it to green** — fix red CI and conflicts on the same branch, answer
   review. A human merges.

Changing only Markdown? Steps 4–5 don't apply
([`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md) "Docs-only changes"). Running a spike?
This loop doesn't apply at all ([`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md)
"Spikes").

### Protocol docs — read when

| Read | When |
|---|---|
| [`docs/spec-driven-development.md`](docs/spec-driven-development.md) | Reading, writing, or changing `SPEC.md`; the spec is silent or wrong; a change is too big for one PR, so it needs a plan. |
| [`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md) | Anything Git or GitHub: taking or filing an issue, scope, branching, committing, opening or watching a PR, merging, docs-only changes, spikes. |
| [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md) | Writing tests. |
| [`docs/ci.md`](docs/ci.md) | Changing CI or `check`; CI fails in a way you don't understand. |
| [`docs/documentation.md`](docs/documentation.md) | Writing or editing any doc, naming files, auditing docs for drift. |

## Commands

<!-- TEMPLATE: fill in from the project's stack (a stack module supplies
these — see TEMPLATE.md). -->

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install | `{{INSTALL_CMD}}` |
| **Check — the gate** | `{{CHECK_CMD}}` |
| Fix formatting and autofixable lint | `{{FIX_CMD}}` |
| Run one test, or a few | `{{TEST_CMD}}` |
| Run the project | `{{RUN_CMD}}` |

`check` runs everything the gate requires — lint, format check, typecheck,
tests, build, whatever the stack has — and never modifies files. CI runs this
one command ([`docs/ci.md`](docs/ci.md)), so green locally means green in CI.

## When in doubt

- **The spec is silent, ambiguous, or wrong** → don't guess. If proceeding
  means guessing at behavior or risking an invariant, stop: add an open
  question to `SPEC.md`, raise it (with the user, or on the issue), and
  resolve it by editing the spec before writing code that depends on it
  ([`docs/spec-driven-development.md`](docs/spec-driven-development.md)).
- **Adjacent work** — an edge case, a follow-on idea, tech debt — becomes its
  own issue, not a `TODO` and not part of this PR
  ([`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md) "Scope").
- **Doc drift you spot while working** → fix it in a separate docs-only PR,
  or file it ([`docs/documentation.md`](docs/documentation.md) "Doc audit").
